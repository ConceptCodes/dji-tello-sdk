# DJI Tello Go SDK

I wanted to create a simple and easy-to-use SDK for the DJI Tello drone. The goal is to provide a simple interface for 
- controlling the drone 
- getting telemetry data
- streaming video
- taking photos and videos

The DJI Tello drone is a small, lightweight drone that is easy to fly and has a lot of features.
